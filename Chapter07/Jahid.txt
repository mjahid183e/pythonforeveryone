This is a course for intermediate and advanced-level Welsh learners who want to develop their craft in creative writing, whether in the form of short stories, dialogue, descriptions, radio drama or other forms. This course will provide an opportunity for participants to practice their Welsh conversation skills, however writing will be the main focus of the weekend. We will work both in groups and individually, and we’ll take short walks around Tŷ Newydd’s beautiful surroundings and engage in writing challenges to find inspiration.

Bethan and Esyllt speaks with a north-Walian accent though the course is suitable for learners from all corners of Wales and beyond. Please note that this course is not aimed towards entry nor foundation-level learners.

Weekend courses start during the late afternoon on Friday, and come to an end after lunch on Sunday.
